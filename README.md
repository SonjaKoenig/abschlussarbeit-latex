Inofficial Template for Theses at University of Ulm
===================================================

University of Ulm does not mandate any particular layout for Bachelor and
Master theses. However, if you are looking for inspiration, feel free to clone
and adapt this template.

There is no special class or package. All configuration is done in
`header.tex`; look at `main.tex` for example usage.

Feel free to adapt everything to your liking and submit a pull request
afterwards.
